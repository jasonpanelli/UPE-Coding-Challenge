# UPE-Coding-Challenge
The UPE Coding Challenge for inductees Fall 2018

Use .sln file as project file for Visual Studio C#.

Another option is to create a new Visual Studio C# Project with MainProgram.cs, Maze.cs, and Request.cs found in the Code Challenge folder.

Run in Visual Studio with "Start without Debugging". Since it is a .NET there is no (convenient) way to build/run the project otherwise.

IMPORTANT: Newtonsoft.Json.Linq must be installed in the Visual Studio IDE running the project.
Here is a link to download Json.NET: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json
